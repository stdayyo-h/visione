# ERGO - Project Management Tool

**More Than Just Task Management**

The pandemic has opened doors to a new era of remote working oppurtunities. Not being physically present in the office reduced interaction with co workers and thus their productivity. An employee is not aware of his co workers skills, and the employer only has a vague idea about the skills of his sub workers. 

To bridge this gap, we present ERGO, to manage, to plan and track any type of project, their way.
